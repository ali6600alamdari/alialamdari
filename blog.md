Hello
Subject: Time management in student life
The best ways to make the most of your time are according to conversations with people who have spent part of their time:

1. First, you should prioritize the day's affairs according to their importance and estimate the approximate time of each and place the most important things in your schedule at the right time.

2. Having a weekly schedule, both written and electronic (calendy), is effective in making your schedule more regular.

3. Choosing the best times of the day to do whatever suits you (early mornings are the best time to devote to top priority)

4. Allocate time between all courses in a balanced manner so that all of them are well developed

5. Continued effort in learning content and not thinking that learning will not happen and just wasting time.
